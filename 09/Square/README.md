My game is an update of the Square class. With some slight modifications to my plan and to the program, I decided to make an Etcha-Sketch.
The program prompts the user with a welcome statement, and some basic instructions on how to operate. 
- With (UP), (DOWN), (LEFT), and (RIGHT) keyboard controlls, the user can create their own designs and images with a square that leaves
  behind black squares where it was. 
- Similar to the Square game, the user can press Q to quit, once they are done with their drawing.
